## About Polygon Edge
Polygon Edge is a framework for creating independent, permissioned, EVM based blockchains. When we use the phrase `Polygon Edge` we normally refer to `Release v0.6.3` of the source code. While it can be used to create minimal side chains we would recommend migrating to the latest version of Supernets. Polygon Edge supports PoA as well as PoS consensus mechanisms.

## About Polygon Supernets
Polygon Supernets is the successor of Polygon Edge (`Releases after v0.7`) and includes additional features like rootchain support and inbuilt-bridging between the rootchain and the Supernet. It also introduces a new consensus mechanism called PolyBFT.
